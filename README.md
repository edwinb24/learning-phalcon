# learning-phalcon
1-7-2016 Start working in the phalcon classes with some difficulties when trying to install phalcon. The computer is giving me a hard time when modfying the httpd.config file in Apache to connect to a VirtualHost. After many attempts instaling and uninstalling wamp and phalcon I decided to go ahead and use a different computer which works perfectly through the installation.
1-8-2016 Start working in the first actual lecture working well so far. After small syntax errors keep going without delay to section 2. A small error occur in lecture 6 where the function initialize is called twice after a 
$this->dispatcher->forward([
	'controller' => 'login',
	'action' => 'test'
]);
After some attempts and checking the syntax multiple times the error persisted, I will wait to find an answer from other sources and just continue the classes for now.
